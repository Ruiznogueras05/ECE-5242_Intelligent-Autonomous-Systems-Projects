# ECE 5242: Intelligent Autonomous Systems Projects  

A collection of projects completed during the **Intelligent Autonomous Systems** course at Cornell Tech, Spring 2024. This course provided a comprehensive introduction to advanced concepts in autonomous systems, including sensor integration, machine learning, and real-time decision-making algorithms. Through these projects, I explored cutting-edge technologies and methods to address complex challenges in robotics, reinforcement learning, and autonomous navigation.

## Course Overview  
The **Intelligent Autonomous Systems** course, taught by Professor Daniel Lee, focused on equipping students with the knowledge and skills to design, analyze, and implement autonomous systems. Emphasis was placed on hands-on projects that integrated machine learning algorithms, computer vision, and robotics. Over the course of the semester, I developed a series of projects that demonstrated both technical proficiency and innovative problem-solving.

## Projects Overview  
Below are the four main projects completed during the course, each addressing unique aspects of autonomous systems:

1. [**Traffic Cone Detection and Distance Estimation Using GMM**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/ECE-5242_Intelligent-Autonomous-Systems-Projects/tree/main/Project1_TrafficConeDetection)  
   - Developed an image processing system using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to detect traffic cones in images and estimate their distances.  
   - Leveraged HSV color space processing and projective geometry principles to ensure precise object detection and distance calculation.  

2. [**IMU-Based Gesture Recognition with HMMs**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/ECE-5242_Intelligent-Autonomous-Systems-Projects/tree/main/Project2_IMUGestureRecognition)  
   - Designed a system to classify arm motion gestures using data from gyroscopes and accelerometers.  
   - Implemented Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to accurately predict gestures, enabling applications in real-time human-computer interaction systems.  

3. [**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/ECE-5242_Intelligent-Autonomous-Systems-Projects/tree/main/Project3_SLAM)  
   - Built a system to create accurate 2D occupancy grid maps and localize a mobile robot using LiDAR data.  
   - Employed particle filters and wheel odometry to refine maps iteratively, showcasing potential for real-world autonomous navigation.  

4. [**Reinforcement Learning for MDPs**](https://github.com/Ruiznogueras05/ECE-5242_Intelligent-Autonomous-Systems-Projects/tree/main/Project4_ReinforcementLearning)  
   - Applied reinforcement learning techniques to solve decision-making tasks in environments such as mazes, Acrobot-v1, and MountainCar-v0.  
   - Compared algorithms like Q-learning, REINFORCE, and Value Iteration to optimize navigation strategies and control efficiency.
